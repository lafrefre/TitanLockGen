# Password Generator

This simple web application allows users to generate passwords based on specific criteria. The application runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript.

## Features

- Dynamically updated user interface
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Password generation based on user-defined criteria

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

2. Click the "Generate Password" button.

3. You will be prompted to enter the desired length for the password (between 8 and 128 characters).

4. Confirm whether you want to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters in the password.

5. After providing the necessary inputs, a password entry box should appear, displaying the generated password.

## Known Issues

Currently, there is an issue where the generated password might not update successfully in the password entry box. The prompt and confirmation dialogs work as expected, but there may be a bug in the password generation logic that prevents the updated password from being displayed properly.
